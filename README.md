There are two files that we created to complete the project. One is for cropping the faces using the Haar Cascade Classifier. Second file contains the complete code where the model is created, trained and tested.

## Dataset
Our dataset was created using the 1800+ picture Celebrity Face Image Dataset from Kaggle, which features the faces of 18 celebrities. For each celebrity, we processed the dataset and separated the photos we took into two sections: a front profile face photo in the original folder along with a folder called ‘side’ containing three to five side profile photos from varied angles. 

We have pulled additional 35 photos for 7 other celebrities from the internet for testing purposes.
